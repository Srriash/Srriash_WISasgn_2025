1. **Calculation of area using three different input mechanisms**
   
  **AI command (used perplexity pro)**

      Write me a python program to code for area of circle by asking input from the user. Write me three different codes, 
      
      In one ask the user for the perimeter of the circle and then calculate the area, 
      
      Next ask the user for the volume of a sphere and from that calculate the area of a circle (by using the radius of the sphere)
      
      Third is by asking the user for the area of a cone and calculate the area of a circle(by using the radius of the base of the cone so essentially calculating the area of the base of the cone).
      
      create a gui for all these programs

**2. Calculation of growth rate and doubling time of any bacteria and suggest average time and rate of the given bacteria**

   a.   **AI command (used perplexity pro)**

    Write a python program to calculate the growth rate of a bacteria and its doubling time by asking the user for appropriate inputs like optical densities at two different time points. 

    Also, ask the scientific name of the bacteria. and tell whether it is the usual growth time and doubling time seen in this particular bacteria. use existing data from the internet. 

    Additionally, tell the user if the bacteria input is not on your list and recommend a link to look up the average rate and time.
    
    Code for error message as well. Donot allow the user to input the same value for both time points and OD

   **b. Purpose of this program**
   This program helps the user to calulate the growth rate and doubling time of any given bacteria using two time points and Optical density for those two points. Doing this calculation manually takes a lot of time due to it having logarithmic calculations. It also checks if the values are normal for the given bacteria or not (The list is small though) but if the organism is not found in the list it provides you with a link which takes you to perplexity AI to give you the answer.
