1. Calculation of area using three different input mechanisms

  a. AI command (used perplexity pro)

. write me a python program to code for area of circle by asking input from the user. write me three different codes, in one ask the user for the perimeter of the circle and then calculate the area, next ask the user for the volume of a sphere and from that calculate the area of a circle (by using the radius of the sphere), third is by asking the user for the area of a cone and calculate the area of a circle(by using the radius of the base of the cone so essentially calculating the area of the base of the cone).
. create a gui for all these programs
