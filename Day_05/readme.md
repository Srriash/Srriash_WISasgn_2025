# Rock, Paper, and Scissors - A simple game with a deja vu feeling
## About
It is a simple game where the computer at random chooses the three options and duel's against the user input. It is written with the while loop incorporating if and elif statements.

## AI usage

**Didnot use AI to write the program.** 

I used AI only to figure out how to write the test for computer random choosing.

Used google to figure out the usage of def - return, test - assert functions and colour codes.
