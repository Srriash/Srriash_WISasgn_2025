# Rock, Paper, and Scissors - A simple game with a deja vu feeling
## About
It is a simple game where the computer at random chooses one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors) and duels against the user input. It is written with the while loop incorporating 'if' and 'elif' statements.

## Files
rps_main.py - main file (user interface)

rps_logic.py - Business logic

rps_test.py - Test program for the logic functions

Additionally, a standalone version with both logic and main code combined is available for clarity and quick reference (see the 'rough' folder in 'day_05').

## Dependencies
No 3rd party installation required

## AI usage

**Didnot use AI to write the program.** 

I used AI only to figure out how to write the test for random choosing logic for the computer

Used google to figure out the usage of def - return, assert functions and colour codes.
